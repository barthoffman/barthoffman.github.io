  <p>To manage expectations: </p>

<p>This is my personal website and I&#39;ll keep information about projects I&#39;m working on down to the minimum. I&#39;m involved in different projects and will use the channels appropriate to them to share the information.
For some of them this will not be it.</p>

<p>A little about me:</p>

<p>I was born in October 1978, that&#39;s two years after Apple was incorporated and three after MicroSoft started. My dad was an electrician with an interest in computers so I can&#39;t remember not having a computer around.
Even as a kid I liked to know how things worked but taking the computer apart as a kid was not always considered appropriate :) </p>

<p>Next to sometimes wiring projects for my father, as a kid you easily fit in the crawling space underneath houses, he took my brother and my to a computer club where people would talk about computers, software, gaming and other electric stuff. Although I gave Basic a shot I guess I was more interested in computer games and how they worked. We got to spent time on almost any brand available, ranging from the commodore 64, to the atari 512 STF, STE to the following x86. This hasn&#39;t stopped as computers evolved continuously. </p>

<p>Building your own computers you get to know all kind of manufacturers especially as playing games most of the times continuously required higher-end computers. Wiring the cables and connectors, installing different OS&#39;s, versions of them from scratch and playing around with them was something you did to play the latest games. Then the consoles came around and the interest didn&#39;t stop. After the Atari 2600, playing with Nintendo at friends, came the Playstation 1 at the time I was in secondary school. </p>

<p>And then the internet arrived in Europe. However, being in my teens let&#39;s say my interest changed and soon I was working to buy my my first windsurfing gear, first car, motorcycle and other outdoor stuff. The minute I started working however the computer was invading most of the &quot;then regular&quot; work environments in the form of cash registers, administrative areas and all kind of new areas. Next to my school I started working at a Dutch DIY and got courses in all kinds of materials like plumbing, painting etc. I absolutely loved to learn new stuff and had a blast installing cash registers and doing projects. Had to spend an extra year in school as I was spending my hours in real life projects, something teachers didn&#39;t always like unfortunately.</p>

<p>I started writing software the minute my first job was repetitive and boring and I realised I could actually let the computer do most of my work. Starting in &quot;old&quot; stuff like for instance access Databases, writing simple html websites, which I still do sometimes (see this website for example) I started creating solutions for the companies I worked at.
This hasn&#39;t stopped since and most of the times after the solution was realised I had made my own job redundant.</p>

<p>Instead of thinking of this as a bad thing that&#39;s when I decided that would be my job. Work somewhere, see a solution, create and write it and of to the next project. I made this my job and enjoyed every step of the way. Then somewhere in 2009 I got my first iPhone and with it came a development-kit for third-party developers. The minute I started working in Objective-C I knew this was something I would like to use. As of 2010 I took the step to go at it independently and up to this point haven&#39;t regretted it for a day! So if you&#39;re looking for a freelance developer get in touch!</p>
