Let's just say I'm curious, love to learn and improve processes.

I have been a freelance iOS developer writing software for iPhone, iPad, Mac OS X, watchOS and tvOS since the Apple SDK came out. Sometimes venturing into front-end, back-end or android if I like it.

Please contact me via email or one of the networks below.
