Cleaned up my old website today. Got some questions from people who wanted to see what I was up to. Not really a big blogger so please don't expect a lot of posts all of a sudden. First thing I did today was killing my old static website and moved to Jekyll. I actually am using the basic template as it's nice and minimal, guess I'm not in to a lot of colours and fancy whistles and bells. 

What I like about Jekyll is the fact that it has an easy way to support code snippets in a simple layout. As some of the things I could write about is probably about iOS or Mac OS X I guess a "hello world" in Apple's Swift is suitable. 
The code snippet actually will look like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
	print("Hello, world\n")
//  prints "Hello, world" followed by a new line character

{% endhighlight %}

Here are links if you'd like to know more about [Jekyll docs][jekyll] or the [swift language][swift]. Don't forget to learn about [Objective-C Programming][obj-c] however, the link will get you to a great book to start.
